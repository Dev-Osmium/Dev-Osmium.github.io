			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>I plan to go to <a href="https://battlecode.org">MIT Battlecode</a> this year, which is an AI programming competition where I need to make
			digital things think for themselves. Last year the competition was robots planting trees and shooting each other. I didn't get to compete 
			last year, but hopefully I can this year.</p>
			<h3>Past GitHub Repositories</h3>
			<p>Here can be found all of my GitHub repositories from previous years. Let's hope I can compete this year!</p>
