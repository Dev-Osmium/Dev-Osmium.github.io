			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>After I killed the OtmasBot, I decided to reboot it, but I couldn't think of a name. Therefore, I chose NewBot, which, in addition to being 
			one of the laziest names I could think of, also speaks to my utter lack of understanding of Discord4J and Discord.JS. It doesn't do much at 
			the moment, but I'm planning some new commands</p>
			<h3>Technical Details</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Compiled with Java 8</li>
				<li>Maven</li>
				<li>Currently resides in 4 .java files</li>
			</ul>
