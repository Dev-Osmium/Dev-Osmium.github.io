                <h1>Finding the right materials</h1>
                <p>Our preliminary reports suggest small veins of Tritanium Ore, beneath Y level 64. My team assures me, finding them won’t be our biggest problem. The real problem is finding that pesky Dilithium Ore. All our findings suggest concentrations occur below Y level 32. Some serious mining may be required, before finding those stuff.  A Fortune Pick is a must on this mission. Bad thing, we can’t replicate those stuff, or I’ll literally be swimming in it!

                Some useful gear the boys showed me, oh and I’ll need them back! Those things ain’t cheap.
                    </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Matter Scanner. Quite a nifty gadget! Will definitely be useful, but requires a Pattern Storage and some Pattern Drive, to store all the scanned patterns, and if you want, you can use it to read up on any info you need!</li>
                    And most importantly, <strong>DO NOT PRESS ‘C’</strong> while having a Matter Scanner in your inventory, or you will have a big GUI pop at you. Trust me, those things are quite scary!
                    <li>Phaser. In my opinion, having one of these babies is always useful. You don’t know when you might get in a tight spot, and you can always use it to shut up those loud cows.</li>
                    <li>Phaser Rifle. A weapon for a real man! I just love the sound that puppy makes.</li>
                    <li>Energy Pack. If you don’t have the resources to upgrade your weapon’s battery, you can always stock up on energy packs.</li></ul>
                <h1>Getting on your feet</h1>
                <p>Let’s say, you found all you need, unlikely I know, but if you do. Seeing as you would be starving, you would want to get the basics up and running, so you can replicate some amazingly delicious and very sustaining, as well as delicious, Emergency Ration, … what? Don’t look at me like that! Now let’s get back to business.</p>
                <p>Isolinear Circuit !!! I want you have at least a stack of these things. The boys can’t stop nagging me how important these things are. If you ask me, the’re obsessed with them. The’re scattered all over the lab. You can’t walk anywhere without stepping on one. I’ve squashed a few myself.</p>
                <p>Remember the Matter Scanner, you can link it with a Pattern Storage and put a few empty Pattern Drive, and you’ll be good to go. Run off and scan your favorite blocks. Don’t mind that fact that you’ll destroy them and you’ll need 10 of them, to get to 100 % on the pattern decoding. You can still try and replicate them, if you like getting covered in Matter Dust, because you’ll be failing left and right, if you don’t have the know how.</p>
                <h1>It's a "matter" of time</h1>
                <p>You’ve built a Replicator! Great job ! Now you can die happy!<br>
                    ……… Just kidding!<br>
                    To start using that thing, you’ll need a lot of preparation. It all starts with your first scanned item pattern. You need to store it in a Pattern Drive and stick it in a Pattern Storage. Then you need to connect your Pattern Storage to a Pattern Monitor and finally to your Replicator. Then just use the Pattern Monitor to send a replication command and watch the Replicator do it’s thing. Just be careful tho! Without a few, let’s say 5 Tritanium Plate in your replicator, you’ll be needing a lot of milk to stop that nasty radiation poisoning! Actually, it doesn’t make a lot of sense, how exactly will milk help you there, but the lab boys said it will. Ah.. What do I know? <br>

                    What !?<br>
                    It doesn’t work ?<br>
                    Well, of course dummy! You need something to replicate it from.  You don’t just wish it into existence. Build yourself a Decomposer, and start breaking down that useless cobblestone you have laying around everywhere. It’s disgusting! Once you have enough Matter, you can transfer it either by Matter Pipe or by placing the Decomposer next to the replicator. Whatever floats your boat !</p>
