				<h3>Net Neutrality</h3>
				<p>Well. This is a fun time to be an American. <a href="https://twitter.com/AjitPaiFCC">FCC Chairman Ajit Pai</a> has made it clear 
				that he wants  to roll back the Title II protections surrounding the Internet and Telecommunications. These basically state that 
				your ISP (Comcast, Verizon, etc.) can't slow down or block specific sites because they or you haven't paid more money for the 
				"Deluxe" or "Hyper-Deluxe" or whatever the heck they call it. Though it's not specified in the Contitution, we have a right to a 
				free Internet, and Pai has made it quite obvious that he will not back down. The FCC has ignored the millions of comments 
				opposing the plan, and has even faked a DDoS attack to hide the fact that they shut down comments for a period of time. 
				This is a bleak day for the open Internet.</p>
