			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>I started programming in <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> after a visit to the Museum of
			Science in Boston, Massachusetts. After I had finished learning Scratch, I moved on to <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>. Though I never really got into it, this laid the foundation for transistioning into Java later on. I like Java because of how organized everything has to be, and because I have really granular control over almost every aspect of my program. I'm on my school's robotics team, and we've won Chairman's Award 3 out of the 4 years we've been a team, which is really impressive. There are seven teams in a 10 mile radius of my town, and we're the only team to have even gone to the District Championship.</p>
			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p>Let's be honest, the real reason you're here is because you want docs for my programs. Well, here you go! (Honestly I probably won't ever get around to making actual docs for these, but I try to have them make sense, and if you really have an issue, don't be afraid to submit a GitHub issue!)</p>
